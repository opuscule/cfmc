						<blockquote class="fs-4">Dr Manor sees me, my husband and my mother-in-law and we have had to wait a while a couple of times, especially after we were in the examining room, but it doesn't bother us because he's patient and careful with us, isn't rushed when we ask lots of questions, and his nurse and the other staff members are friendly and professional. We couldn't be happier with the practice.</blockquote>

						<blockquote class="fs-4">I have been seeing Dr. Manor for 30+ years. Only had an issue once with one of the staff, and they didn't stay long, so it resolved itself. Dr. Manor takes his time with his patients, but rarely have I had to wait an inordinate amount of time, and that was when they had to call rescue for one of the patients. Staff is wonderful and pleasant to work with.</blockquote>

						<blockquote class="fs-4">The staff here are incredibly friendly! I made my appointment one month out and had my physical, including my lab tests, all in one visit. One week later I get a phone call to let me know that everything was perfectly good and asked me if there were any other concerns I had. My doctor was very knowledgeable and spoke with me at length about my concerns. Great place to go!</blockquote>

						<blockquote class="fs-4">I have been a patient of Carrboro Family Medicine for a few decades. As with any healthcare providers who faced the challenges of the pandemic, they held strong. The clinic has had some changeover in staff but I would like to comment that I had a recent appointment there and had a great experience.  The receptionist was friendly & efficient, the nurse was as well. I am now a patient of Dr. Yulia Neyman who I think was excellent - very thorough and reassuring.</blockquote>
